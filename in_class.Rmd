Join `weather` and `airports` (will need some intermediate steps)  

```{r}
weather_airports <-  flights %>% 
  left_join(weather, by = c("origin", "year", "month", "day", "hour")) %>% 
  left_join(airports, by = c("origin" = "faa"))
weather_airports
```


From the `weather_airports` data you created (via joining tables). Find the average `distance` the `carrier` `UA` flies whose `origin` is `JFK`
```{r}
weather_airports %>% 
  filter(origin == "JFK") %>% 
  filter(carrier == "UA") %>% 
  summarise(Avg_Dist = mean(distance))
```


Similar to the previous statement, calculate the average `distance` of each `carrier` whose `origin` is `JFK` and display them from highest to lowest.
```{r}
weather_airports %>% 
  filter(origin == "JFK") %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  summarise(Avg_Dist = mean(distance)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Avg_Dist))
```

Display a plot of the top 5 `carrier` that flew the greatest overall distance in March of 2013, result should show `carrier` as well as `total_distance`
```{r}
weather_airports %>% 
  filter(year == 2013, month == 3) %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  summarise(total_distance = sum(distance)) %>% 
  arrange(-total_distance) %>%
  head(5) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=carrier, y=total_distance)) +
  geom_col()
  
weather_airports %>%
   filter(year == 2013, month == 3) %>%
   group_by(carrier) %>%
   summarise(total_distance = sum(distance)) %>%
   top_n(5, total_distance) %>%
   ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(carrier, total_distance), y=total_distance)) +
   geom_col() + 
   coord_flip()

```


Which `planes` `model` was the most common in `year` 2004?
```{r}
weather_airports %>% 
  filter(year == 2004) %>%
  group_by(model) %>% 
  summarise(most_common = count(n=n()))
```

Show a histogram with 20 bins of the `hour` from `flights`.
```{r}
flights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=hour)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20)
```


Make a scatter plot of average `day` `average_distance` from `flights` with the x-axis as `carrier` `UA` and y-axis as `carrier` `AA`
```{r}
flights %>% 
  filter(carrier == "UA" | carrier == "AA") %>% 
  group_by(carrier, day) %>%
  summarise(Avg_Dist = mean(distance)) %>% 
  spread(key=carrier, value = Avg_Dist) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = UA, y = AA)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")


flights %>%
  filter(carrier == 'UA' | carrier == 'AA') %>%
  group_by(carrier, day) %>%
  summarize(avg_dist = mean(distance)) %>%
  spread(key = carrier, value = avg_dist) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = UA, y = AA)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

Assume all data is already cleaned. From the `planes` table, using `year`, `engine`, and `seats` - build a model to predict `manufacturer` (filtered for you). Describe your model and interpret your results.
```{r}
clean_data <- planes %>% 
  filter(manufacturer %in% c('BOEING', 'AIRBUS INDUSTRIE', 'BOMBARDIER INC', 'AIRBUS', 'EMBRAER')) %>%
  filter(!is.na(year)) %>% 
  rename(Class = manufacturer) %>% 
  mutate(Class = as.factor(Class),
         engine = as.factor(engine),
         id = row_number(),
         year = lubridate::as_date(year),
         year = as.factor(lubridate::year(year))) %>%
  select(id, Class, year, engine, seats)
```

```{r}
colSums(is.na(clean_data))
```


```{r}
head(clean_data, 10)
